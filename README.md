# Educational System Relatedness Predictor
***Requires Python 3+***

## DataStats
This program parses the data file and creates a graph of the number of data points available to each country. The x axis is country (by country code), and the y axis is number of available data points in the dataset.

## Predictor
This program asks the user to input a country code, and then parses through the data and analyzes it (using cluster analysis and K-Nearest-Neighbors) to output 5 countries to which the inputted country is closest to in terms of its educational system. When prompted with "Continue?" either enter "true" to be prompted to input another country, or any other string to exit the program.
