Divide the total number of students in the official primary school age range who are enrolled in primary or secondary education by the population of the same age group and multiply the result by 100. NERA should be based on total enrolment of the official primary school participation age group in primary and secondary education for all types of schools and education institutions, including public, private and all other institutions that provide organized educational programmes (pre-primary education must be excluded). NERA gives more precise measure of the participation of the official primary school age population to the education system (excluding pre-primary education). It reflects the actual level of achievement of the Universal Primary Education (UPE) goal. In fact, while the Net enrolment rate (NER) shows the coverage of pupils in the official primary school age group in the primary education level only, the NERA extends the measure to those of the official primary school age range who have reached secondary education because they might access primary education earlier than the official entrance or they might skip some grades due to their performance. Increasing NERA might mirror improving participation of children in the official primary school age, the decrease of the target population or both. A value of 100% indicates theoretically that the country has accomplished the UPE goal. However, this condition is not sufficient for UPE due to, for example, a high repetition rate, which might lead pupils to dropout after primary school age without completing primary education. The difference between NERA and NER provides a measure of the proportion of children in the official primary age group who are enrolled in secondary education.",UNESCO Institute for Statistics

Starting salary,"Starting salaries refer to the average scheduled gross salary per year for a full-time upper secondary teacher (general programs only) with the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified at the beginning of the teaching career. Salaries are in equivalent USD converted using PPPs for private consumption. Statutory salaries refer to scheduled salaries according to official pay scales, while actual salaries refer to the average annual salary earned by a full-time teacher. The salaries reported are gross (total sum paid by the employer) less the employer’s contribution to social security and pension, according to existing salary scales. Salaries are “before tax”, i.e. before deductions for income tax. Teachers’ salaries are one component of teachers’ total compensation. Other benefits, such as regional allowances for teaching in remote areas, family allowances, reduced rates on public transport and tax allowances on the purchase of cultural materials, may also form part of teachers’ total remuneration. There are also large differences in taxation and social-benefits systems in OECD countries. All this should be borne in mind when comparing statutory salaries across countries. Data after 2009 is not comparable to data for 2009 and before due to changes in methodology.

Tasks at Level 1A require the reader to locate one or more independent pieces of explicitly stated information; to recognize the main theme or author’s purpose in a text about a familiar topic, or to make a simple connection between information in the text and common, everyday knowledge. Typically the required information in the text is prominent and there is little, if any, competing information. The reader is explicitly directed to consider relevant factors in the task and in the text. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than later assessments, which use a scale from Level 1B to Level 6. PISA 2000/2003/2006 Level 1 data have been included in this database as Level 1A because they are based on an identical score range.  Use caution in comparing proficiency scores across years.

Tasks at level 1B require the reader to locate a single piece of explicitly stated information in a prominent position in a short, syntactically simple text with a familiar context and text type, such as a narrative or a simple list. The text typically provides support to the reader, such as repetition of information, pictures or familiar symbols. There is minimal competing information. In tasks requiring interpretation the reader may need to make simple connections between adjacent pieces of information. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Below Level 1 to Level 5) than later assessments, which use a reading scale from Below Level 1B to Level 6.

Some tasks at level 2 require the reader to locate one or more pieces of information, which may need to be inferred and may need to meet several conditions. Others require recognizing the main idea in a text, understanding relationships, or construing meaning within a limited part of the text when the information is not prominent and the reader must make low level inferences. Tasks at this level may involve comparisons or contrasts based on a single feature in the text. Typical reflective tasks at this level require readers to make a comparison or several connections between the text and outside knowledge, by drawing on personal experience and attitudes. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than later assessments, which use a scale from Level 1B to Level 6. PISA 2000/2003/2006 Level 2 data have been included in this database as Level 2 because they are based on an identical score range. Use caution in comparing proficiency scores across years.

Tasks at level 3 require the reader to locate, and in some cases recognize the relationship between, several pieces of information that must meet multiple conditions. Interpretative tasks at this level require the reader to integrate several parts of a text in order to identify a main idea, understand a relationship or construe the meaning of a word or phrase. They need to take into account many features in comparing, contrasting or categorizing. Often the required information is not prominent or there is much competing information; or there are other text obstacles, such as ideas that are contrary to expectation or negatively worded. Reflective tasks at this level may require connections, comparisons, and explanations, or they may require the reader to evaluate a feature of the text. Some reflective tasks require readers to demonstrate a fine understanding of the text in relation to familiar, everyday knowledge. Other tasks do not require detailed text comprehension but require the reader to draw on less common knowledge. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than later assessments, which use a scale from Level 1B to Level 6. PISA 2000/2003/2006 Level 3 data have been included in this database as Level 3 because they are based on an identical score range. Use caution in comparing proficiency scores across years.

Tasks at Level 4 involve retrieving information require the reader to locate and organize several pieces of embedded information. Some tasks at this level require interpreting the meaning of nuances of language in a section of text by taking into account the text as a whole. Other interpretative tasks require understanding and applying categories in an unfamiliar context. Reflective tasks at this level require readers to use formal or public knowledge to hypothesize about or critically evaluate a text. Readers must demonstrate an accurate understanding of long or complex texts whose content or form may be unfamiliar. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than later assessments, which use a scale from Level 1B to Level 6.

Tasks at level 5 involve retrieving information require the reader to locate and organize several pieces of deeply embedded information, inferring which information in the text is relevant. Reflective tasks require critical evaluation or hypothesis, drawing on specialized knowledge. Both interpretative and reflective tasks require a full and detailed understanding of a text whose content or form is unfamiliar. For all aspects of reading, tasks at this level typically involve dealing with concepts that are contrary to expectations. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than later assessments, which use a scale from Level 1B to Level 6. In this database, 2000/2003/2006 Level 5 data are calculated figures based on the current Level 5 (626 to 698) rather than the figures presented for Level 5 (626+) in PISA Reports.

LO.PISA.REA.6,PISA: 15-year-olds by reading proficiency level (%). Level 6,"Percentage of 15-year-old students scoring higher than 698 on the PISA reading scale. Tasks at Level 6 level typically require the reader to make multiple inferences, comparisons and contrasts that are both detailed and precise. They require demonstration of a full and detailed understanding of one or more texts and may involve integrating information from more than one text. Tasks may require the reader to deal with unfamiliar ideas, in the presence of prominent competing information, and to generate abstract categories for interpretations. Reflect and evaluate tasks may require the reader to hypothesize about or critically evaluate a complex text on an unfamiliar topic, taking into account multiple criteria or perspectives, and applying sophisticated understandings from beyond the text. A salient condition for access and retrieve tasks at this level is precision of analysis and fine attention to detail that is inconspicuous in the texts. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than later assessments, which use a scale from Level 1B to Level 6. Level 6 data were not available in the 2000/2003/2006 PISA Reports, so these figures were calculated based on the current PISA Reading Proficiency Level 6 (698+).

Some tasks at level 2 require the reader to locate one or more pieces of information, which may need to be inferred and may need to meet several conditions. Others require recognizing the main idea in a text, understanding relationships, or construing meaning within a limited part of the text when the information is not prominent and the reader must make low level inferences. Tasks at this level may involve comparisons or contrasts based on a single feature in the text. Typical reflective tasks at this level require readers to make a comparison or several connections between the text and outside knowledge, by drawing on personal experience and attitudes. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than later assessments, which use a scale from Level 1B to Level 6. PISA 2000/2003/2006 Level 2 data have been included in this database as Level 2 because they are based on an identical score range. Use caution in comparing proficiency scores across years.

Level 3,"Percentage of 15-year-old female students scoring higher than 480 but lower than or equal to 553 on the PISA reading scale. Tasks at level 3 require the reader to locate, and in some cases recognize the relationship between, several pieces of information that must meet multiple conditions. Interpretative tasks at this level require the reader to integrate several parts of a text in order to identify a main idea, understand a relationship or construe the meaning of a word or phrase. They need to take into account many features in comparing, contrasting or categorizing. Often the required information is not prominent or there is much competing information; or there are other text obstacles, such as ideas that are contrary to expectation or negatively worded. Reflective tasks at this level may require connections, comparisons, and explanations, or they may require the reader to evaluate a feature of the text. Some reflective tasks require readers to demonstrate a fine understanding of the text in relation to familiar, everyday knowledge. Other tasks do not require detailed text comprehension but require the reader to draw on less common knowledge. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than later assessments, which use a scale from Level 1B to Level 6. PISA 2000/2003/2006 Level 3 data have been included in this database as Level 3 because they are based on an identical score range. Use caution in comparing proficiency scores across years.

Tasks at Level 4 involve retrieving information require the reader to locate and organize several pieces of embedded information. Some tasks at this level require interpreting the meaning of nuances of language in a section of text by taking into account the text as a whole. Other interpretative tasks require understanding and applying categories in an unfamiliar context. Reflective tasks at this level require readers to use formal or public knowledge to hypothesize about or critically evaluate a text. Readers must demonstrate an accurate understanding of long or complex texts whose content or form may be unfamiliar. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than later assessments, which use a scale from Level 1B to Level 6. PISA 2000/2003/2006 Level 4 data have been included in this database as Level 4 because they are based on an identical score range. Use caution in comparing proficiency scores across years.

Level 5,"Percentage of 15-year-old female students scoring higher than 626 but lower than or equal to 698 on the PISA reading scale. Tasks at level 5 involve retrieving information require the reader to locate and organize several pieces of deeply embedded information, inferring which information in the text is relevant. Reflective tasks require critical evaluation or hypothesis, drawing on specialized knowledge. Both interpretative and reflective tasks require a full and detailed understanding of a text whose content or form is unfamiliar. For all aspects of reading, tasks at this level typically involve dealing with concepts that are contrary to expectations. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than later assessments, which use a scale from Level 1B to Level 6. In this database, 2000/2003/2006 Level 5 data are calculated figures based on the current PISA Proficiency Level 5 (626 to 698) rather than the figures presented for Level 5 (626+) in PISA Reports.

LO.PISA.REA.6.FE,PISA: Female 15-year-olds by reading proficiency level (%). Level 6,"Percentage of 15-year-old female students scoring higher than 698 on the PISA reading scale. Tasks at Level 6 level typically require the reader to make multiple inferences, comparisons and contrasts that are both detailed and precise. They require demonstration of a full and detailed understanding of one or more texts and may involve integrating information from more than one text. Tasks may require the reader to deal with unfamiliar ideas, in the presence of prominent competing information, and to generate abstract categories for interpretations. Reflect and evaluate tasks may require the reader to hypothesize about or critically evaluate a complex text on an unfamiliar topic, taking into account multiple criteria or perspectives, and applying sophisticated understandings from beyond the text. A salient condition for access and retrieve tasks at this level is precision of analysis and fine attention to detail that is inconspicuous in the texts. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than later assessments, which use a scale from Level 1B to Level 6. Level 6 data were not available in the 2000/2003/2006 PISA Reports, so these figures were calculated based on the current PISA Reading Proficiency Level 6 (698+).

Some tasks at level 2 require the reader to locate one or more pieces of information, which may need to be inferred and may need to meet several conditions. Others require recognizing the main idea in a text, understanding relationships, or construing meaning within a limited part of the text when the information is not prominent and the reader must make low level inferences. Tasks at this level may involve comparisons or contrasts based on a single feature in the text. Typical reflective tasks at this level require readers to make a comparison or several connections between the text and outside knowledge, by drawing on personal experience and attitudes. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than later assessments, which use a scale from Level 1B to Level 6.

Tasks at level 3 require the reader to locate, and in some cases recognize the relationship between, several pieces of information that must meet multiple conditions. Interpretative tasks at this level require the reader to integrate several parts of a text in order to identify a main idea, understand a relationship or construe the meaning of a word or phrase. They need to take into account many features in comparing, contrasting or categorizing. Often the required information is not prominent or there is much competing information; or there are other text obstacles, such as ideas that are contrary to expectation or negatively worded. Reflective tasks at this level may require connections, comparisons, and explanations, or they may require the reader to evaluate a feature of the text. Some reflective tasks require readers to demonstrate a fine understanding of the text in relation to familiar, everyday knowledge. Other tasks do not require detailed text comprehension but require the reader to draw on less common knowledge. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than later assessments, which use a scale from Level 1B to Level 6. PISA 2000/2003/2006 Level 3 data have been included in this database as Level 3 because they are based on an identical score range. Use caution in comparing proficiency scores across years.

Tasks at Level 4 involve retrieving information require the reader to locate and organize several pieces of embedded information. Some tasks at this level require interpreting the meaning of nuances of language in a section of text by taking into account the text as a whole. Other interpretative tasks require understanding and applying categories in an unfamiliar context. Reflective tasks at this level require readers to use formal or public knowledge to hypothesize about or critically evaluate a text. Readers must demonstrate an accurate understanding of long or complex texts whose content or form may be unfamiliar. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than later assessments, which use a scale from Level 1B to Level 6.

Level 5,"Percentage of 15-year-old male students scoring higher than 626 but lower than or equal to 698 on the PISA reading scale. Tasks at level 5 involve retrieving information require the reader to locate and organize several pieces of deeply embedded information, inferring which information in the text is relevant. Reflective tasks require critical evaluation or hypothesis, drawing on specialized knowledge. Both interpretative and reflective tasks require a full and detailed understanding of a text whose content or form is unfamiliar. For all aspects of reading, tasks at this level typically involve dealing with concepts that are contrary to expectations.  2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than later assessments, which use a scale from Level 1B to Level 6. In this database, 2000/2003/2006 Level 5 data are calculated figures based on the current PISA Proficiency Level 5 (626 to 698) rather than the figures presented for Level 5 (626+) in PISA Reports.

Tasks at Level 6 level typically require the reader to make multiple inferences, comparisons and contrasts that are both detailed and precise. They require demonstration of a full and detailed understanding of one or more texts and may involve integrating information from more than one text. Tasks may require the reader to deal with unfamiliar ideas, in the presence of prominent competing information, and to generate abstract categories for interpretations. Reflect and evaluate tasks may require the reader to hypothesize about or critically evaluate a complex text on an unfamiliar topic, taking into account multiple criteria or perspectives, and applying sophisticated understandings from beyond the text. A salient condition for access and retrieve tasks at this level is precision of analysis and fine attention to detail that is inconspicuous in the texts. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than later assessments, which use a scale from Level 1B to Level 6. Level 6 data were not available in the 2000/2003/2006 PISA Reports, so these figures were calculated based on the current PISA Reading Proficiency Level 6 (698+).
